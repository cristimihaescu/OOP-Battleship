Overview:
The OOP Java Battleship Game is a digital implementation of the classic board game where two players place their naval fleet on a grid and take turns firing shots at each other's ships until one player's fleet is completely destroyed. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Java.

Getting Started:
To play the game, first, make sure you have Java installed on your computer. Then, download the game's source code and open it in an IDE that supports Java.

To start the game, run the BattleshipGame.java file. This will launch the game's graphical user interface, where you can select the game mode and enter player names.

Gameplay:
The game starts by prompting the players to place their ships on the grid using a set of predefined rules. Once the ships are placed, the players take turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships by entering coordinates on the grid. If a shot hits a ship, the player is notified, and they get to take another turn. The game continues until one player's fleet is completely destroyed, and the other player is declared the winner.

Game Rules:

    The game can be played in either single-player or two-player mode.
    Each player has a set of ships with different sizes that must be placed on the grid before the game starts.
    Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
    Ships cannot overlap with each other.
    Players take turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships by entering coordinates on the grid.
    If a shot hits a ship, the player is notified and gets to take another turn.
    The game ends when one player's fleet is completely destroyed, and the other player is declared the winner.
